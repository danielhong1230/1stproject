# Project201801_Microarray analysis
Project201801 started on Sep/06/2018. Project201801 aims to analyze a dataset of the microarray of Y-Kim, Ph.D. 
The analysis consisted three subanalyses as follows: 
    1) the identification of differentially expressed genes in each compared groups, 
    2) find enriched gene ontologies, 
    3) construction of network models of differentially expressed genes and gene ontologies.
