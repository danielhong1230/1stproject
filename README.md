# Project201801_Microarray analysis
Project201801 is started on Sep/06/2018.
The aim of Project201801 is to analysis a dataset of microarray from Y-Kim, PhD.
The analysis includes three subanalysis as follows: 
    1) the identification of differerntially expressed genes in each compared groups, 
    2) find enriched gene ontologies
    3) construction of netwrok models of differentially expressed genes and gene ontologies.
